# DADI CLI

## Overview

DADI CLI is a command-line tool to help with the installation and customisation of the various products of the DADI platform.

## Usage

Commands always start with `npx dadi-cli <product> <command>`, taking different parameters and flags depending on the operation.

The command `npx dadi-cli help` shows a list of all the available commands for the various products, whilst `npx dadi-cli help <product>` and `npx dadi-cli help <product> <command>` provides detailed information about a product and a command, respectively.

## Development

To get started, run:

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the `npx dadi-cli help` command
node index.js help
```

By default, CLI will communicate with the live registry server at https://registry.dadi.tech. When developing, you might want to use your own local registry, in case you want to test assets that are not yet available on live.

To do this, grab a copy of theÂ [registry repository](https://github.com/dadi/registry), start a local server, and tell CLI the URL of the registry to use.

```shell
# If your registry server is available at http://localhost:7100
REGISTRY_URL="http://localhost:7100" node index.js help
```
